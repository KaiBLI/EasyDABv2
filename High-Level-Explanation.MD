# The EasyDAB v2 Board
# What is it?
The EasyDAB v2 board is a DAB Radio exciter. It allows you to broadcast a digital radio signal compliant with DAB/DAB+ specifications that can be received on compatible DAB Digital Radios sold across Europe, certain parts of Asia and Australia.

# What is DAB?
DAB stands for Digital Audio Broadcasting, it is standard for broadcasting a digital radio signal in 55 countries around the world. It's the result of a European research project and publicly released in 1995 with consumer grade radios appearing in the late 90s. DAB found its earliest successes and populized widly across the UK thanks to the efforts of Pure, who manufacturered a variety of radios at a price point that was reasonable to the average consumer. The BBC and other broadcasters in the UK rapidly embraced the standard and by the early 2000s there were two national multiplexes as well as around 5 regional multiplexes. DAB however had a number of false starts and was abandoned in a number of other countries and only later found success with the launch of DAB+, a revision to the original standard which utilizes AAC-MP4 a codec that doubles the efficiency of transmitted audio, allowing multiplex operators to double the number of stations broadcast with no reduction of audio quality. 

# What about the Americas? 
Okay, I had to put this question in as I'm based in the US. No country in the Americas uses DAB at the time of writing. The US and Canada instead adopted Ibiquiti's IBOC (In Band On Channel) standard, officially known to the FCC as NRSC5, and to the general population as HD Radio. HD Radio is a very different standard to DAB whereby HD Radio will sandwich an analog FM or AM signal allowing the receiver to dynamically switch between analog and digital as signal conditions permit. DAB on the other hand uses Band III (174Mhz-240Mhz) with a wider carrier, this allows more stations to be broadcast on a single frequency and works better for countries with more centralized broadcasting approaches, while IBOC suits the highly decentralized radio market of the US. Of an interesting note, Canada originally did small scale experimentation with DAB on the L Band, however this was abandoned in favor of using the same standard as the US. Utilization of the L Band was removed from the DAB specification in January 2017. Digital Terrestrial Radio has seen lesser usage in the US and Canada due to the popularization of Satellite Radio on the L Band thanks to SiriusXM. 
Band III in the US is allocated for VHF System M Digital TV Channels 7-13 (174Mhz-216Mhz) as well as Amateur, Land Mobile, Fixed in the 216-240Mhz ranges.
